    "Personally, as an active reserve officer in the squadron, and as having previously performed a commanding role thus aware of the weighty implications of the relatively low serviceability percentages of the squadron's helicopters, I find a great interest in contributing to this kind of analysis and classification work. \n",
    "\n",
    "As stated in the official request, no analysis of the provided malfunctions data is currently being performed, other than calculations of statistics, which do not help make data-driven decisions (for example: average time between malfunctions, percentage of serviceability (i.e. the total number of helicopters available for flight each morning), etc.). Moreover, various decisions regarding helicopters' spare parts, and the presence of maintenance personnel in the heliport (i.e. where helicopters are parked) are a result of rules of thumb, and \"gut feelings\", thus not knowledge-based.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many times, in the past the weekly flights plan has changed. As mentioned, the weekly flights plan dictates the squadron's progression in training plan, and involves many resources and constraints (for example: meeting the maintenance routines, allocating the required training resources - flight areas, etc.). A work which connects the serviceability of the squadron's helicopters and the weekly flights plan has been conducted in the past, albeit in a non-comprehensive and inclusive manner (based on a small number of samples, and without a specific reference to the malfunctions issue). In this work I would like to reveal the impacts of the weekly flights plan on the malfunctions amount and type, thus allowing a better decisions to be taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important feature of a helicopter is it being able to fly under difficult weather conditions. The squadron's helicopters are capable and required to perform their missions in the presence of hard weather conditions. However, increased number of malfunctions, may reduce the helicopters' serviceability for carrying out these and other missions. A decision for having flights under difficult weather conditions on purpose, may increase the risk factors for specific types of malfunctions. Thus, having this knowledge may spur the squadron's commanders to make some improvements meant to handle these increased risk factors wisely (for example: manufacturing a dedicated sealing component, changing the flight areas in real-time, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Squadron's operations on ground during various weather conditions is another significant issue, since more than 95% of time helicopters are not in air. As stated in the official request - the helicopters are routinely parked outdoor (unlike other aircrafts), and therefore more exposed to weather damage - wind, rain, extreme temperatures (heat or cold), humidity and radiation. Some equipment may be in use, if it turns out that these weather damages are causing a great increase in the number of malfunctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To summarize, these are the general and personal motivations for carrying out this project:**\n",
    "* This project may contribute to increase the serviceability of the squadron's helicopters, by providing concrete recommendations for adjusting maintenance processes and flight planning.\n",
    "* This contribution is translated into a better and more accurate utilization of the Israeli taxpayer's money, by increasing the availability of helicopters for flights, instead of being grounded.\n",
    "* A personal desire to promote an issue that has greatly influenced, and still affects, the service experience of many others and mine.\n",
    "* Proof of concept of performing such analysis work, outside the Air Force, allowing additional squadrons to take the same road. This may also allow further un-classified data to be analysed outside the Air Force, offering an outsourced way of doing these kinds of jobs."
